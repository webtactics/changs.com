<h1 class="glutentitle">Products and Recipes</h1>
<p>Whether you choose to avoid gluten for lifestyle or health reasons, going gluten-free doesn&rsquo;t mean missing out. Chang&rsquo;s has a great range of <a title="Gluten Free" href="gluten-free-products">gluten free</a> and <a title="Wheat-free-sauces" href="products/wheat-free-sauces">wheat free (tamari) products</a> options just for you!</p>
<p>An Australian laboratory has independently tested all of our gluten-free products so if the label says &lsquo;Gluten Free&rsquo; you can be worry free.</p>
<h3>Do you have questions about the world of &lsquo;gluten free&rsquo;?</h3>
<p>We have the answers. And if you&rsquo;d like more information, visit <a title="Coeliac Australia" href="http://www.coeliac.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coeliac Australia</a> who has everything there is to know about being gluten free or coeliac.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:<br /></strong>Foods carrying a gluten-free claim must have been tested and found to contain &ldquo;<strong>No detectable</strong>&rdquo; gluten. By law, however, the manufacturer is still required to list ALL ingredients, which can cause confusion.</p>
<p>In the manufacture of Chang&rsquo;s Soy based sauces, gluten is first completely removed from the wheat flour by fermentation. This leaves starch, (which is the extract of wheat left). All Chang&rsquo;s sauces have been tested and found to contain NO detectable gluten.</p>
<p>Chang&rsquo;s Soy sauce has been tested for 3-MCPD and 1,3-DCP by Australian Laboratory. This sauce is naturally brewed, therefore does not contain these chemicals.</p>
