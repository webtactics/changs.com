Complex flavours make it suitable for stir-fried beef, pork or chicken as well as being very tasty as a dipping sauce for steamed fish.

<li>Combine marinade ingredients, add the beef and set aside. Boil water in readiness to blanch the broccoli.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a wok to very hot and drop in the noodles in three or four batches. Be careful as they’ll puff right up in seconds. Drain noodles on kitchen paper, reserving the oil in the wok, straining if needed. Reduce the heat of the oil and cook the marinated beef until it colours, drain and put aside.</li>
<li>Heat the oil to very hot and return the beef, cooking until golden brown. Drain again on kitchen paper and discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil.Blanch the broccoli in boiling water.</li>
<li>Add the garlic and ginger to the wok and stir for a second before returning the beef to the wok along with the drained, still firm broccoli and bamboo shoots.</li>
Add the oyster, light soy and dark soy sauces and salt,stirring to coat the meat and vegetables. Add the stock or water and finally the dissolved cornflour and stir until the sauce thickens.
<li>To serve, place the noodles on a plate and the stir fry in the centre on top.</li>
<li>If you’d like this dish to be gluten free, be sure select the Chang’s Rice Vermicelli and a gluten free chicken stock.</li>
